This app is largely the Samsung sample video player Smart TV app with a few tweaks:
- its a middleman based template for several apps, covering various channels on British Tech Network - http://www.britishtechnetwork.com/
- the variations are handled by alternate data configs in the data directory, eg data/mac and data/photo.
- the SITE variable controls which site is built.  The default is the mac one. To build an other, do:
    SITE=photo middleman build
- see the directories in the data directory for the available sites.

TODO
- see if Samsung approves it...

- show the episode date so its clear how new/old it is
- track/indicate (via cookies?) what user has watch/not watched
- episode number X / Y is going to 2 lines on 3.5.2/2012 emulator
- if no episodes, put up message to that effect (probably not needed)
- if episode fails to load, put up message saying that
